    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Reminiscent of countertop service and carhop days, there is nothing better than a perfect milkshake. Luckily, making one at home is extremely easy. This easy milkshake recipe gives you the perfect ratio of milk to ice cream and is completely customizable!</p>
    <h3>Can I make it ahead of time?<h3>
	<p>Surprisingly, yes! Blend up your milkshake and pour it into your glass, then stick it back in the freezer. Just let it sit out for 5 minutes or so before it&apos;s drinkable again! It&apos,s a fantastic party hack.</p>
	<h3>What are good mix-ins?</h3>
	<p>Oooh, our favorite question! The mix-ins are endless. You can add Oreos, Reese&apos;s Peanut Butter Cups, brownies, cookie dough, chocolate syrup, or fruit. Anything you like! Add peanut butter, bananas, and chocolate chips for a Chunky Monkey vibe, or caramel, coconut, and chocolate chips for a Samoas-like milkshake. Or go all out with wine for a Boozy Red Wine Milkshake.</p>
	<p>If you don&apos;t want your mix-ins completely blended, like brownies or cookie dough, stir them in after blending the ice cream and milk.</p>
	<h3>Can i make a milkshake without a blender?</h3>
	<p>Yes! And it&apos;s easier than you think! Add your ice cream and milk to large bowl and use a rubber spatula to stir until the milk is incorporated and then pour into a glass. Simple!</p>
	<h3>How do I turn it into malt?</h3>
	<p>I love malts and think they are far superior to milkshakes. You can turn your milkshake into a malt by adding 2 tablespoons malt powder to your ice cream and milk and blend them altogether!</p>
