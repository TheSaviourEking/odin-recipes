	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Fresh, juicy, summer peaches star in this rendition of a classic margarita cocktail.

	  Aged tequila adds a caramel and toffee background to complement the fruit. Peach schnapps in place of the traditional triple sec amplifies the stone fruit even more. Lime zest brightens up the salt rim for a burst of citrus with each sip.

	  Whether youre by the pool, at a backyard BBQ, or running the grill, this summertime sipper will beat the heat no matter where you are.</p>
	<h3>What&apos;s a Margarita?</h3>
	<p>A margarita is a cocktail made from tequila, triple sec, and lime juice and sipped from a salt-rimmed glass.

	  Over time, this basic formula has seen many variations from the ingredients used to how its served. Fruits such as mango, strawberry, melons, and peaches as I use here add a sweet fruity flavor.

	  The drink can also veer savory and spicy with the addition of cucumbers or jalapeno chiles. Fresh herbs like basil or cilantro can also amp up the experience. Then there is the always popular frozen margarita where the chosen ingredients are blended with ice into a slushy. Quite refreshing!</p>
