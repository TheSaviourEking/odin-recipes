    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Lay eggplant slices on a large baking sheet lined with a cooling rack. Lightly season eggplant planks with salt on both sides and let sit for 30 minutes to release excess moisture. Pat dry with paper towels.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, pepper, and Italian seasoning. In a large high-sided pan, heat 3 tablespoons oil over medium heat until shimmering. Working in batches, coat eggplant evenly in flour mixture, shaking off excess, and add to pan. Fry eggplant until golden, about 2 minutes per side; transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining eggplant, adding more oil to pan as needed.</li>
      <li>In a medium bowl, mix together all filling ingredients until smooth. Place 1 heaping tablespoon of filling onto the bottom of each eggplant slice and roll up into a log.<li>
	<li>Preheat oven to 375. In a 9-x-13 baking dish, spread  cup tomato sauce in an even layer. Arrange rolled eggplant in a single layer over sauce. Top with remaining 1 cup mozzarella, 1 cup tomato sauce, and  cup Parmesan.</li>
      <li>Bake until sauce is bubbly and cheese is melty, about 30 minutes.</li>
